# Machine Learning Predictions - SpaceShip Titanic
## Objective
This project aims to predict the destination of passengers aboard a fictional spaceship based on various features, including their home planet, age, and other personal characteristics. By analyzing the relationships between these variables, we aim to build a robust machine-learning model that accurately forecasts passenger destinations. This project also seeks to uncover insights into passenger demographics and behaviors that influence their likelihood of being transported to specific destinations, with a focus on improving feature engineering and model performance.

## Project Workflow
The project follows the same approach as used in all ML projects except for the Data Collection. We will go through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering and extraction, preprocessing data, data cleansing, data training, and finally deployment of trained model.
